# 📸 BioAI: Visual Proof of Concept (Prototype Gallery)

**Status:** 0.7.6 (Industrial Closed Feature)

**Platform:** Android (Fire HD 10 Tablet) via .NET MAUI / Native P-Invoke

---

## ⚠️ Note on Illustrations

The screenshots presented here are taken from the **active development** phase and the **technical demonstrators** of BioAI.

These are **functional prototypes** (Engineering Samples). Their primary objective is the validation of the **BioAI C-Core (65 KB)**, the ** decision-making process**, and the **Safety Reflexes**. The User Interface (HMI) serves purely to visualize internal states and does not represent a final consumer design.

## 📂 Gallery Content

### 1. System Boot & Integrity Check

Screenshots demonstrating the startup sequence of the `libbioai.so` core on an Android-based end device.

* **Validation:** Successful memory allocation test and instinct loading routine within the restricted Android environment.

### 2. Decentralized Smart Grid Demo (HMI)

Visualization of autonomous solar agents in mesh operation.

* **Function:** Demonstrates the collaboration of three independent BioAI agents without centralized cloud control.
* **Technical Details:**
* **Green/Red Indicators:** Display the status of the "Observer Link" (Server connection).
* **Progress Bars:** Visualize local energy prioritization (Charge first, then share).
* **Status Messages:** Displays "MESH FLOW" vs. "LOCAL CHARGE" based on the real-time decisions of the  core.



### 3. Debugging & Error Handling

Insights into the development phase, including intercepted exceptions and system telemetry. This demonstrates the transparency and auditability of the system in the event of a fault—crucial for industrial certification.
