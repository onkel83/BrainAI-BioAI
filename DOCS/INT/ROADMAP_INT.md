# BioAI Core: Strategic Roadmap 2025 / 2026

The BioAI Core Intellectual Property (IP) has officially reached **"Industrial Gold Standard"** status. This roadmap defines the strategic transition of the core into its commercial full release and the technological evolution within the hardware sector.

---

## Detailed Milestones

### 1. Established Codebase: Version 0.5.5

**(Legacy / Deprecated)**

* **Status:** *Industrial Beta / Stable Fix*.
* **Description:** The foundational architecture for Hard-Safety and deterministic control was fully implemented. This version served as the baseline for internal and external long-term evaluation.

### 2. Core Finalization: Version 0.7.5

**(Current State)**

* **Status:** **Feature-Closed** status.
* **Description:** This version leap marks the formal conclusion of internal validation for the core logic. The codebase is now considered **Final Audit Code** and is being prepared for the commercial release phase.

### 3. Commercial Release: Version 1.0

**(Target: Early January 2026)**

* **Status:** **Official Full Release / Industrial Production**.
* **Description:** The IP transitions into the status of a finalized commercial asset. From this point forward, strategic development will focus primarily on performance scaling and enterprise integration.

## Hardware Evolution

### 4. Hardware Prototyping: 1st FPGA Implementation

**(Planned: End of Q2 2026)**

* **Strategic Realignment:** The focus shifts toward hardware-level development for maximum performance scaling.
* **Objective:** Implementation of the BioAI Core on **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)**. This step is designed to secure our **technological advantage** and create the foundation for proprietary, neuromorphic chip designs.
